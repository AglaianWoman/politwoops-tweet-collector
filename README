= Install Beanstalkd

http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/download.html

Requires installing the libevent-dev package on apt-based systems.

= Install Python dependencies

* beanstalkc (pip install)
* anyjson (pip install)
* boto (pip install)
* tweetstream (1.1.1, install from https://bitbucket.org/runeh/tweetstream/src)
* MySQLdb (python-mysqldb package on apt-based systems)

= Edit config file

In the [tweets-client] section, add your Twitter account's username and password. It is this account that will be authenticated against to make the API requests.

In the [beanstalk] section, change the "tube" parameter to the name you want to use for your queue in beanstalk.

In the [database] section, update the "host", "port", "username", "password", and "database" sections with your own details, if the defaults are not appropriate.

= Running

Run tweets-client.py to start streaming items from Twitter into the beanstalk queue. Append the lib directory to the PYTHONPATH, either persistently or as part of the command:

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/politwoops-twitter-client/lib ./bin/tweets-client.py -v

Then run politwoops-worker.py to start pulling the tweets out of beanstalk and loading them into MySQL:

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/politwoops-twitter-client/lib ./bin/politwoops-worker.py -v
